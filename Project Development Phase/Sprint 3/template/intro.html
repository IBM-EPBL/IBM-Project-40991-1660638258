			<div class="inside">Renewable energy, such as wind and solar energy, plays an increasing role in the supply of energy worldwide. Wind energy is a key player in the field of renewable energy. In Europe, the capacity of wind energy production has doubled from 2009 to 2010<br><br>
				The amount of electricity generated by wind increased by almost 273 TWh in 2021 (up 17%), 45% higher growth than that achieved in 2020 and the largest of all power generation technologies. Wind remains the leading non-hydro renewable technology, generating 1 870 TWh in 2021, almost as much as all the others combined.
